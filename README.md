# 🎈 ROUGHNESS CALCULATOR

**New Advanced Features:**

    🎯 **ROI Selection**: Define rectangular regions of interest for targeted analysis

    📏 **Interactive Scale Calibration**: Set scale by measuring pixel distances between reference lines

    🎨 **Advanced Image Processing**: Enhanced contrast controls and preprocessing within selected regions

    📊 **Multi-Region Analysis**: Process multiple regions with different parameters

    **Workflow:**
    1. **Upload & Calibrate**: Load SEM image and set scale using reference markers
    2. **Region Selection**: Define rectangular ROI for analysis
    3. **Image Enhancement**: Apply contrast and threshold adjustments to ROI
    4. **Edge Detection**: Extract sidewall profile from processed region
    5. **Analysis & Export**: Calculate roughness metrics and export results
